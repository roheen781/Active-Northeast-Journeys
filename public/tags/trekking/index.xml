&lt;p&gt;This trekking holiday takes you to the Namdapha National Park located in eastern Arunachal Pradesh. Namdapha is one of the largest protected areas of Asia as well as the northernmost lowland evergreen rainforest of the world. We take you walking for 5 days through thick rain forest, grasslands and riverine areas of the national park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perched between the East Himalayan and the Indo-Burmese Biodiversity hotspots Namdapha is home to over 1000 species of plants, 425 avian species and over 90 species of mammals. This is also the only wildlife park to host four big cats in India, namely the Royal Bengal Tiger, Spotted Leopard, Snow Leopard and the Clouded Leopard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tour takes you far from the hustle bustle of daily life and deep into inarguably the wildest region of India.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This trek takes you to the hills of Sikkim and North Bengal, a mystical land of abundant natural beauty with verdant forests, quaint sub alpine villages and high towering mountains. Sikkim is home to the magnificant Kanchanjunga Massif, the third-highest mountain on earth. The pinnacle of this majestic mountain is perennially snowcapped and ever towering over the region like the deity that she is. The trek will take you across state and sometimes national borders, as we make our way south from the Barsey Rhodondren Sanctuary along the Nepalese frontier, walking the phenominal Singalila Ridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This region is perched between the giant plains of the Gangetic and Brahmaputra valleys and the high Himalayan massif. Barsey Rhododendron Sanctuary spans over the razor sharp Singalila Range which forms the border wall between India and Nepal. Ranging from an altitude of about 7000 to 14000 feet, the flora of the sanctuary ranges from broadleaf and coniferous forests to alpine meadows, but the queen of this sanctuary is the Rhodendron of which over 600 kinds can be found here itself. The route takes us from a starting altitude of about 2700 mts up to about 3750 mts. The Singalila ridge, which is about 50 kms long offers phenominal panoramas of the valleys of Nepal and Sikkim, and the high peaks of Himalayas especially the sights of 5 out of the 6 highest peaks on earth. The mornings and evenight offer spellbinding vistas, almost an amphitheatre where we are the spectators and the high peaks the protagonists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This trek can be quite flexible in duration without losing its charms. Please write in to us with your ideal duration and we will get back with an appropriate itinerary.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
