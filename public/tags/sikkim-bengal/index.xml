&lt;p&gt;Sikkim, bordering Tibet in the north and northeast, Bhutan in the east, Nepal in the west, and West Bengal in the south is a mountanious state. Sikkim was its own mountain kingdom till 1975 and still retains a very distinctive personality. The meditative, mural-filled traditional monasteries of Tibetan Buddhism coexist with Hindu shrines of the ever-growing Nepali community, with both religions creating some astonishing latter-day megasculptures to adorn the skyline.Clean, green and &amp;lsquo;all organic&amp;rsquo; since 2016, Sikkim is mostly a maze of plunging, supersteep valleys thick with lush subtropical woodlands and rhododendron groves, rising in the north to the spectacular white-top peaks of the eastern Himalaya. When clouds clear, an ever-thrilling experience from many a ridge-top perch is spotting the world&amp;rsquo;s third-highest mountain, Khangchendzonga (8598m), on the northwestern dawn horizon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This particular tour takes you from Darjeeling in west bengal to the south and western districts to sikkim.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This trek takes you to the hills of Sikkim and North Bengal, a mystical land of abundant natural beauty with verdant forests, quaint sub alpine villages and high towering mountains. Sikkim is home to the magnificant Kanchanjunga Massif, the third-highest mountain on earth. The pinnacle of this majestic mountain is perennially snowcapped and ever towering over the region like the deity that she is. The trek will take you across state and sometimes national borders, as we make our way south from the Barsey Rhodondren Sanctuary along the Nepalese frontier, walking the phenominal Singalila Ridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This region is perched between the giant plains of the Gangetic and Brahmaputra valleys and the high Himalayan massif. Barsey Rhododendron Sanctuary spans over the razor sharp Singalila Range which forms the border wall between India and Nepal. Ranging from an altitude of about 7000 to 14000 feet, the flora of the sanctuary ranges from broadleaf and coniferous forests to alpine meadows, but the queen of this sanctuary is the Rhodendron of which over 600 kinds can be found here itself. The route takes us from a starting altitude of about 2700 mts up to about 3750 mts. The Singalila ridge, which is about 50 kms long offers phenominal panoramas of the valleys of Nepal and Sikkim, and the high peaks of Himalayas especially the sights of 5 out of the 6 highest peaks on earth. The mornings and evenight offer spellbinding vistas, almost an amphitheatre where we are the spectators and the high peaks the protagonists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This trek can be quite flexible in duration without losing its charms. Please write in to us with your ideal duration and we will get back with an appropriate itinerary.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
