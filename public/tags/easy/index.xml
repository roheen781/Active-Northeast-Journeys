&lt;p&gt;Stretching 600km along the Brahmaputra River Valley, Assam is the largest and most accessible of the Northeast States. Well known for its national parks abounding in rhinoceroses, elephants, deer and primates (with respectable tiger numbers too), more than 3000sq km of lush tea plantations and a vibrant mix of cultures, it welcomes visitors with a subtly flavored cuisine and a hospitable population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cycle tour of Assam takes you on both the banks of central Brahmaputra Valley, giving you experiences of living in tea plantations, indulging in wildlife spotting, experiencing its rich cuisine while cycling through lush and pleasant surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
