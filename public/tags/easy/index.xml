&lt;p&gt;Stretching 600km along the Brahmaputra River Valley, Assam is the largest and most accessible of the Northeast States. Well known for its national parks abounding in rhinoceroses, elephants, deer and primates (with respectable tiger numbers too), more than 3000sq km of lush tea plantations and a vibrant mix of cultures, it welcomes visitors with a subtly flavored cuisine and a hospitable population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cycle tour of Assam takes you on both the banks of central Brahmaputra Valley, giving you experiences of living in tea plantations, indulging in wildlife spotting, experiencing its rich cuisine while cycling through lush and pleasant surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Separating the Brahmaputra valley of Assam from the plains of Bangladesh lies hilly Meghalaya (‘the abode of clouds’). The state’s population predominantly comprises the Jaintia, Khasi and Garo tribal groups, who live in the eastern, central and western parts respectively. Geographically, Meghalaya is the first hill range that the rain baring monsoon clouds hit after crossing peninsular India and the Bay of Bengal.  Mawsynram and Cherrapunjee (Sohra) set on dramatic horseshoes of rocky cliffs receive some of the highest rainfall on earth, creating very impressive waterfalls and carving out some of Asia’s longest caves. Meghalaya’s tribal groups also maintain their matrilineal system, with property and names passed down from mother to daughter, and men moving in with their maternal in-laws after marriage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this tour we explore the best of the Khasi and Jaintia hills.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
