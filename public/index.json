    "body": " Active-Northeast is an initiative of North by Northeast Journeys, one of the first to operate active tours in the region. For the past decade we have actively worked towards facilitating experiential travel which is Active, Interactive and Authentic in its truest form. Our tours of Northeast India include Cycling, Treks \u0026amp; Walks, Motorcycle \u0026amp; Overland, Multi-Activity, Family Adventures, Wildlife, Culture and Youth travel , all of which have local history, culture, interactions and the environment as their centerpiece. Although, most of our tours are activity based, our true focus lies on the people, the culture and environment of this region.\n Our area of operations  The Region at a glance This little known corner of the Indian Subcontinent sharing international borders with Bhutan, Tibet, China, Myanmar and Bangladesh is connected to mainland India by a small sliver of land in the state of West Bengal popularly known as the Chickens neck. Consisting of Eight states this region is formed like a gigantic basin with the Brahmaputra and Barak valleys taking center stage.The northern border with Tibet and China is barricaded by the giant east Himalayan landmass, in the east the densely forested Patkai bum and Naga Patkai ranges bordering Burma take over running south all the way to Chaifil Tlang and Uiphum Tlang ranges in Mizoram (which further runs off east to the Chin hills and Arakan Yoma of Burma).In the south the Jaintia, Khasi and Garo Hills of Meghalaya bordering the rich plains of Bangladesh completes the formation.This region is incidentally the closest that the Himalayan mountain range gets to the coast. This geographical factor added to the fact that this region also receives some of the highest rainfall in the planet has resulted in the one of the greatest diversity in flora and fauna and hence also a diverse mix of people.\nThe People Perhaps the same reason that makes this region so rich in its natural diversity also makes it the most Ethnic, Linguistic and Cultural diverse region in the Indian sub-continent. For example, the state of Arunachal Pradesh itself has over 26 major tribes with over 100 sub-tribes and clans speaking some 50 odd dialects. These tribes provide a cultural bridge between India and south East Asia, China, Inner Asia and Burma by ethnic and linguistic angles, as most of these tribes migrated here from the North and the East over the centuries.These eight states in themselves constitute a single linguistic region with about 220 languages in three different language groups (Indo-Aryan, Sino-Tibetan and Austric).The earliest recorded history can be traced back only to the Ahom kings (16thAD) who ruled the Brahmaputra valley. Unlike the rest of India, majority here bear Mongoloid features.\nThe Environment This region has a predominantly humid sub-tropical climate with hot, humid summers, severe monsoons and fairly mild winters. Along with the west coast of India, it has some of the Indian sub-continent’s last remaining rain forests which support’s diverse flora and fauna and several endemic species. It has been pooled under the Eastern Himalayan and the Indo-Burmese Biodiversity hot spots. The close proximity of the High Himalayas to the coast has created a compact stretch of land with a multitude of vegetation. If we take a closer look, we see that the Ecology of the region varies from Alpine Tundra in the northern regions to Tropical and Sub tropical Rainforests in the lower areas. The central river valleys support Grasslands and large wetland areas. This variety in Eco-systems has created a heaven for bio-diversity. This region also boasts of the highest density of protected Wildlife Reserves in the country. Kaziranga, Manas, Nameri and Namdapha National Parks are some of the better known ones. It also has some of the highest densities of Tigers, Elephants and the Great one horned Rhinoceros, the only ape species found in India and the only Wildlife parks to have 5 felines’ species\n Head over to our main site for more details \u0026raquo; ",

Our tours of Northeast India include Cycling, Treks \u0026amp; Walks, Motorcycle \u0026amp; Overland, Multi-Activity, Family Adventures, Wildlife, Culture and Youth travel , all of which have local history, culture, interactions and the environment as their centerpiece. Although, most of our tours are activity based, our true focus lies on the people, the culture and environment of this region.\nRight from the onset our intent has been to make a difference, to be meaningful and most of all sustainable in the long run. We had a lot of experience in the operational side of running tours, however our mind was far outweighed by questions of how to go about things beyond the operations. The main questions were to do with how we could be more impactful locally, how our activities did not change the overall local way of life and how could our tours be more authentic and bring out the local prospective. Over the years we have evolved, mostly through trial and error. We started with forming a all local team of willing individuals who were not tainted by the usual understanding of ‘Tourism’ and yet very handy in their surroundings. We have tried our best to generate income for locals in a way that though fairly substantial is not their primary source of imcome, a way that encourages them to continue their usual way of life. We dont encourage locals to dress up, dance etc for tourist, for these things are best observed in its true authenticity during festivals. We never bargain with the bottom of the chain, the people who make all this a reality, we firmly belive in dignity and equality of labour. Finally, we follow all the age old ways of ‘Leave no trace’ travel.\n Head over to our main site for more details \u0026raquo;  Team at work ",
