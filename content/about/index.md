For the past decade we have actively worked towards facilitating experiential travel which is Active, Interactive and Authentic in its truest form. Our tours of Northeast India include Cycling, Treks & Walks, Motorcycle & Overland, Multi-Activity, Family Adventures, Wildlife, Culture and Youth travel , all of which have local history, culture, interactions and the environment as their centerpiece. Although, most of our tours are activity based, our true focus lies on the people, the culture and environment of this region.

Right from the onset our intent has been to make a difference, to be meaningful and most of all sustainable in the long run. We had a lot of experience in the operational side of running tours, however our mind was far outweighed by questions of how to go about things beyond the operations. The main questions were to do with how we could be more impactful locally, how our activities did not change the overall local way of life and how could our tours be more authentic and bring out the local prospective. Over the years we have evolved, mostly through trial and error. We started with forming a all local team of willing individuals who were not tainted by the usual understanding of ‘Tourism’ and yet very handy in their surroundings. We have tried our best to generate income for locals in a way that though fairly substantial is not their primary source of imcome, a way that encourages them to continue their usual way of life. We dont encourage locals to dress up, dance etc for tourist, for these things are best observed in its true authenticity during festivals. We never bargain with the bottom of the chain, the people who make all this a reality, we firmly belive in dignity and equality of labour. Finally, we follow all the age old ways of ‘Leave no trace’ travel.
