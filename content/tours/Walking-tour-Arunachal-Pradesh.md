Arunachal Pradesh, ‘the dawn lit Mountains’ is the easternmost state of India. This tour is based in the eastern part of Arunachal Pradesh close to the Myanmar and Chinese frontiers, a maze of greenery and home to a vibrant mix of cultures. This is the land where three giant river valleys come down and meet the plains, hence giving birth to the mighty Brahmaputra. Home to the earliest tea producers of the subcontinent, some of the earliest oil finds of the world and a string of vibrant wildlife parks.

The tour includes a series of walks across these eastern most river valleys. This is a land of the Animist and Theravada Buddhist tribes of the state who are still very rooted in their culture and traditions. You will be walking through wildlife sanctuaries, camp next to pristine lakes, visit idellic villages, indulging in local cuisines and have authentic interactions with the people who live here.
