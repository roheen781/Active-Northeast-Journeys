This cycle tour of Eastern Arunachal Pradesh (the eastern most state of India) takes you to the watershed of the mighty Brahmaputra River.  India’s wildest and least explored state, Arunachal (literally the ‘land of dawn-lit mountains’) rises abruptly from the Assam plains as a mass of densely forested and impossibly steep hills, culminating in snowcapped peaks along the Tibetan border. This state is home to 26 major tribes with over 100 sub-tribes and clans speaking some 50 odd dialects. Arunachal is perhaps the last sanctuary for India’s natural and anthropological heritage.

This particular part of Arunachal Pradesh is where the three easternmost tributaries come together to form one of the mightiest river valleys of the world. Surrounded by the Himalayas and the Patkai Range on three sides and Brahmaputra valley on the other, this region is the home of numerous tribal cultures. Each one of these tribes are unique in their language, food, textile pattern, headgear, machetes etc, yet so distinct with strong Mongoloid features, tight knit society, and their nonchalant ease in and around the forests.
