This cycle tour of Arunachal Pradesh takes you all the way to the end of the road close to the tri-Juncture of Bhutan, Tibet and India. The setting of this ride is in western Arunachal Pradesh, the Buddhist belt of the state. This is one of the highest motorable routes of the eastern bit of the Himalayas, at places taking you to an altitude of 4200mts. The road condition though not at the best is still better than most parts of Arunachal Pradesh. The route takes you riding along the Bhutan border on little used roads. Slush, mud, broken roads steep inclines, long downhills, snow etc are all parts of this ride.The cycling phase covers between 300 to 650 Kms depending on the duration you choose, for most parts riding on little used backroads of this region historically known as the Monyul. Incidentally, in a rough manner we mirror the same route the Dalai Lama used in his exodus from Tibet in the year 1959.
