Sikkim, bordering Tibet in the north and northeast, Bhutan in the east, Nepal in the west, and West Bengal in the south is a mountanious state. Sikkim was its own mountain kingdom till 1975 and still retains a very distinctive personality. The meditative, mural-filled traditional monasteries of Tibetan Buddhism coexist with Hindu shrines of the ever-growing Nepali community, with both religions creating some astonishing latter-day megasculptures to adorn the skyline.Clean, green and 'all organic' since 2016, Sikkim is mostly a maze of plunging, supersteep valleys thick with lush subtropical woodlands and rhododendron groves, rising in the north to the spectacular white-top peaks of the eastern Himalaya. When clouds clear, an ever-thrilling experience from many a ridge-top perch is spotting the world's third-highest mountain, Khangchendzonga (8598m), on the northwestern dawn horizon.

This particular tour takes you from Darjeeling in west bengal to the south and western districts to sikkim.
